# BIRCH Clustering Implementation

This project provides a Python implementation of the BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) clustering algorithm without relying on external machine learning libraries. It includes the core BIRCH clustering components (`CFNode`, `CFLeaf`, `CFBranch`), the main clustering function `birch_cluster`, utility functions like `collect_leaf_centroids`, and an implementation of the k-means algorithm to further process the clustering results.

## Features

- Pure Python implementation of BIRCH clustering.
- K-means clustering for further refinement of BIRCH results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone 

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
- cd BIRCH
- pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

Open the example.ipynb notebook file and run the example code. Modify it as per the needs.

### Developed By

Lemlem Asaye, as part of a comprehensive exam at NDSU.
